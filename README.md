# Node.js w/ Sockets Boilerplate
## Compiled by SixBeeps

I got a good bit of the server-side code from various online sources, the rest was coded by me. Put all of your client-side code in the files under the `static` folder, and your server-side code in index.js.

This template contains some commented-out socket snippets for your convenience. They have three slashes in front of them so you can easily locate them.
